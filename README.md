# Tabbi.Todo

This is a concept market place that introduces a completely anonymous user-base, and completely untraceable currency.
You can create and account and login, then you add a Tabbi.
A Tabbi is basically a post, like a tweet, containing info on what task (or tabbi) you'd like someone to do for you, with a reward. For this version it's basic text inputs..but in a future update, you'd be able to add image and video and audio files and even documents, containing detailed info on your tabbi.

For example, you own a business, and there are some products you want to push to generate income. You can post a tabbi to get people to find buyers for you and pay them a commision on every client they bring to purchase.

The app keeps users' identity anonymous even when you submit a request to do a tabbi. The submitted request is sent to the user who posted the tabbi and they can view your tabbi history,(as in a history of the tabbis you have completed and whether you fit the profile of someone they'd want to work with).

They can the accept your request or deny your request.
Upon acceptng your request you'd then begin to chat with them or contact them through the app, end to end encrypted and completely anonymous.

In your profile, you can see a history of all your tabbis. The ones you've been rewarded for and the ones yet to be rewarded.

Users will be able to control what data to put out if they submit a request for a tabbi.
Users will be paid in tabbi money, which is the currency of the platform and completely untraceable.

Users will have to buy or sell the tabbi money
Buy, meaning when you deposit, you trade cash for tabbi money at a rate.
Sell, meaning when you withdraw, you trade tabbi money for cash at a rate.

payment can only occur on the platform.

Tabbi posts are completely anonymous. every post will have @username_name001 as the name of the user.
